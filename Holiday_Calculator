# This is an example Python programme which calculates the total cost for a user's
# holiday, using input values and options for: plane cost, hotel cost, and car rental cost.
# The programme is compatible with different input options.

# User inputs ------------------------------------------------------
# city_flight: The city they will be flying to. (each city has a different flight costs)
# num_nights: The number of nights they will be staying at a hotel
# rental_days: The number of days that they will be hiring a car for.

# Functions --------------------------------------------------------
# hotel_cost: This function takes num_nights as an argument, and 
# returns a total cost for the hotel stay.

# plane_cost: This function takes city_flight as an argument and
# returns a cost for the flight (if/else if statements used to retrieve a price based on the chosen city)

# car_rental: his function takes rental_days as an argument and 
# returns the total cost of the car rental (based on daily rental cost.)

# DEFINE A FUNCTION
def add_one(x): # function called add_one has one parameter, x y = x +
    return y


# holiday_cost: This function will take the three arguments hotel_cost, plane_cost, car_rental. 
# Total cost of holiday is returned by calling the hotel_cost, plane_cost and car_rental arguments


# CALLING A FUNCTION

def add_one(x): # function called add_one has one parameter, x y = x +1
    return y
result_num = add_one(5) #create a variable and set it to the value returned by the function. When the function is called, 5 is passed in as an argument. print(result_num) #prints 6
num_plus_one = add_one(10) # The result that the 'add_one' function returns is stored in the num_plus_one variable.
print ("10 plus 1 is equal to: " + str(num_plus_one)+".") # Or even
num = 10
print ("10 plus 1 is equal to: " + str(add_one(num))+".")

# Output:
# Print out all the details about the holiday in a readable way!


# ------------------------------------------------------

# FUNCTION PARAMETERS
result_num = add_one(5)

# SCOPE
def adding(a, b):
    total = a + b
    return (description + str(total))
x= 2
y= 3
description = "Total: "
sum = adding(x, y)
print(sum)


# DEFAULT VALUES

def multiply(num1,num2=5):
    total = num1 * num2
    print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {total}")
times_5 = multiply(6)

# change the value of num2
def multiply(num1,num2 = 5):
    total = num1 * num2
    print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {total}")
times_7 = multiply(6, 7)
# call the function using keyword arguments
times_9 = multiply(num2=6, num1=9)
